# Assignment 0 - Submitting an Assignment
This is an in-class exercise to practice making a simple change to a
Java file and submitting it. Starter code has been provided that simply
prints the phrase "Goodbye World!". You will change the program so that
it prints "Hello World!" instead and the submit your work after
compiling it and executing it to be sure it works.

You will follow the step listing in the Assignment Submission section
below.

## Assignment Submission
You will submit your assignment using GitHub Classroom.  When you are
finished and want to make your final submission, use the checkin
comment "FINAL SUBMISSION":

        git add .
        git commit -m "FINAL SUBMISSION"
        git push origin main

Any submission not having this comment will be assumed to be a
work-in-progress and therefore will be ignored.  This implies that you
must make your final push with this commit comment before the deadline.

## Input
None

## Output
When your program is working correctly, it will print the output shown below;

	$> java HelloWorld

	Hello World!
